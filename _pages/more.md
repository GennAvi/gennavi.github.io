Hello! In this page, I'll tell you a bit more about myself :)


## Music 
I am a fan of black music at large, particularly Hip-Hop, R&B, and Soul. I will post from time to time an album that I have on rotation. Lately, I am listening a lot to Elmiene a British-Sudanese R&B artist. Here is his last mixtape.
